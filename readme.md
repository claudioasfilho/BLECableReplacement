This example shows how to implement transparent serial data connection between two EFR32BG13 SOCs. Please look at the KBA for more details.

It uses the EFR32BG13P632F512GM48 and the Silicon Labs Bluetooth Stack 2.10.0.0, Gecko SDK Suite v2.4.0. , GNU GCC Compiler v 7.2.1

In order to compile this, please make sure you clone this to your Simplicity Studio workspace and that you have installed the right version of the Gecko SDK and Bluetooth Stack.
